                <h1>Javier Sevilla Salcedo</h1>
                <p>I'm Javier Sevilla Salcedo, and I am currently diving into the world of research and teaching at the
                    Systems Engineering and Automation Department at Carlos III University of Madrid. My academic
                    journey began with a B.Sc. in Industrial Electronics and Automation Engineering from the University
                    of Jaén, which opened up a path to a master's in Robotics and Automation right back at Carlos III
                    University.</p>

                <p>I'm currently pursuing my Ph.D. in Electrical Engineering, Electronics, and Automation, which is
                    pretty exciting. Along the way, I've focused on theories and put what I learned into practice. I've
                    had the fantastic opportunity to work in the robotics and automation field within the automotive
                    industry, getting a taste of how these concepts are applied in the real world.</p>

                <p>I've also devoted over four years to some fascinating research areas—automating processes, refining
                    robotics, exploring how robots can interact socially, and diving into Natural Language Processing.
                    Part of my hands-on experience was designing a robotic guitar tuner for my bachelor's project. For
                    my master's thesis, I developed NLP applications that help make social robots more engaging and
                    intuitive.</p>

                <p>My current research interests are pretty broad, with a strong focus on Natural Language Processing.
                    But I'm also passionate about Social Robotics, Deep Learning, and Deep Reinforcement Learning, as
                    well as how robots cognitively perceive and interact with the world.</p>

                                predict gestures that align with a robot's verbal communication. The research evaluates

                                compares the effectiveness and efficiency of the three model variations, demonstrating

                            <p>Two methods are proposed: one for rephrasing existing utterances to retain their meaning
                                but
                                introduce variation, and the other for creating topic-specific speech that adapts to the
                                conversation partner. The results are promising, but challenges such as computational
                                demands, interaction delays, reliance on proprietary models, and the need for subjective
                                evaluation are noted as constraints.

                            <p>Robots are starting to be used in social settings and need to autonomously execute
                                non-verbal gestures to interact naturally with people, synchronizing them with speech.
                                This study
                                introduces a system that employs transformer models, a recent advancement in deep
                                learning, to predict social robots' non-verbal gestures. This system is compared with a
                                previous
                                one that used recurrent networks and conditional random fields, showing that

                                significantly enhance the prediction of non-verbal gestures for social robots.

                            <p>This work examines the use of natural language generation models to improve the fluidity
                                of human-computer conversation by creating a system that generates user-profile-specific
                                descriptions on a variety of topics. This approach moves away from using predefined
                                scripts in conversational agents, aiming to make interactions more natural and friendly.
                                The applications were implemented and showed that integrating these models in
                                conversational agents is highly effective.

                            <p>Social robotics focuses on creating robots that can engage in natural interactions with
                                humans, such as conversing in a human-like manner. A study has introduced deep learning
                                models that enable a robot to produce varied yet semantically consistent paraphrases in
                                Spanish, enhancing its conversational abilities. These capabilities have been
                                incorporated into the Mini robot, which can operate in both English and Spanish and
                                function either locally or on a server. Evaluation of three models—the T5 and Pegasus
                                Transformers, as well as a fine-tuned version of T5 (Finetuned T5)—along with Parrot and
                                a fine-tuned Pegasus for generating paraphrases, revealed that the Finetuned T5 yields
                                less diverse but more accurate paraphrases and is faster by about one second.

                            <p>The advancement of technology and an aging population have created a societal divide
                                between the elderly and the young. Social robotics has the potential to narrow this gap
                                by bringing technology closer to older adults. Despite its potential to assist and
                                reduce loneliness among the elderly, social robotics isn't widely adopted. The article
                                proposes the development of tools to strengthen human-robot interaction and suggests art
                                therapy with social robots to enhance the psychophysical state of the elderly. This
                                intervention aims to maximize the functionality and well-being of older adults while
                                fostering a stronger bond between them and the robots, providing motivation for
                                continued engagement with the technology.

                            <p>Robots are increasingly becoming part of our daily lives, particularly in social contexts
                                where they interact with humans and undertake various tasks. For these social robots to
                                communicate effectively and appear friendly, their speech should not rely on repetitive
                                predefined texts. The paper discusses how advancements in natural language generation
                                models can enhance robot communication, making human-robot interactions more fluid and
                                paving the way for new opportunities and applications within robotics. The
                                implementation of these models has shown promising potential for integrating natural

                            <p>This paper introduces a novel perception architecture for a social robot, inspired by
                                biological mechanisms of endogenous attention, which enriches the robot's understanding
                                of its environment by integrating multiple sensory inputs. The architecture is designed
                                both theoretically and practically for insight into bio-inspired processes and for
                                actual implementation in a robot's system. It includes mechanisms to identify the most
                                important stimuli and is linked with the robot's decision-making system to enable
                                responses to the environment and user interactions. Preliminary test results from
                                deploying this architecture in a real social robot are also presented.
