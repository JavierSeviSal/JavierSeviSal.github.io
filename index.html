                <h1>Javier Sevilla Salcedo</h1>
                <p>I'm Javier Sevilla Salcedo, and I am currently diving into the world of research and teaching at the
                    Systems Engineering and Automation Department at Carlos III University of Madrid. My academic
                    journey began with a B.Sc. in Industrial Electronics and Automation Engineering from the University
                    of Jaén, which opened up a path to a master's in Robotics and Automation right back at Carlos III
                    University.</p>

                <p>I'm currently pursuing my Ph.D. in Electrical Engineering, Electronics, and Automation, which is
                    pretty exciting. Along the way, I've focused on theories and put what I learned into practice. I've
                    had the fantastic opportunity to work in the robotics and automation field within the automotive
                    industry, getting a taste of how these concepts are applied in the real world.</p>

                <p>I've also devoted over four years to some fascinating research areas—automating processes, refining
                    robotics, exploring how robots can interact socially, and diving into Natural Language Processing.
                    Part of my hands-on experience was designing a robotic guitar tuner for my bachelor's project. For
                    my master's thesis, I developed NLP applications that help make social robots more engaging and
                    intuitive.</p>

                <p>My current research interests are pretty broad, with a strong focus on Natural Language Processing.
                    But I'm also passionate about Social Robotics, Deep Learning, and Deep Reinforcement Learning, as
                    well as how robots cognitively perceive and interact with the world.</p>

                            <p>GERT (Gesture-Enhanced Robotics Transformer), a set of three transformer-based models
                                designed to
                                predict gestures that align with a robot's verbal communication. The research evaluates
                                and
                                compares the effectiveness and efficiency of the three model variations, demonstrating
                                that
                                they
                                all perform well (with F-scores ranging from 0.78 to 0.86) while highlighting the
                                balance
                                between model size and performance.

                            <h3>Using Large Language Models to Shape Social Robots’ Speech</h3>
                            <p>Two methods are proposed: one for rephrasing existing utterances to retain their meaning
                                but
                                introduce variation, and the other for creating topic-specific speech that adapts to the
                                conversation partner. The results are promising, but challenges such as computational
                                demands, interaction delays, reliance on proprietary models, and the need for subjective
                                evaluation are noted as constraints.

                            <h3>Predicción de gestos no-verbales usando aprendizaje profundo</h3>
                            <p>Robots are starting to be used in social settings and need to autonomously execute
                                non-verbal
                                gestures to interact naturally with people, synchronizing them with speech. This study
                                introduces a system that employs transformer models, a recent advancement in deep
                                learning,
                                to predict social robots' non-verbal gestures. This system is compared with a previous
                                one
                                that used recurrent networks and conditional random fields, showing that transformers
                                significantly enhance the prediction of non-verbal gestures for social robots.
