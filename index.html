                <h1>Javier Sevilla Salcedo</h1>
                <p>I'm Javier Sevilla Salcedo, and I am currently diving into the world of research and teaching at the
                    Systems Engineering and Automation Department at Carlos III University of Madrid. My academic
                    journey began with a B.Sc. in Industrial Electronics and Automation Engineering from the University
                    of Jaén, which opened up a path to a master's in Robotics and Automation right back at Carlos III
                    University.

                    I'm currently pursuing my Ph.D. in Electrical Engineering, Electronics, and Automation, which is
                    pretty exciting. Along the way, I've focused on theories and put what I learned into practice. I've
                    had the fantastic opportunity to work in the robotics and automation field within the automotive
                    industry, getting a taste of how these concepts are applied in the real world.

                    I've also devoted over four years to some fascinating research areas—automating processes, refining
                    robotics, exploring how robots can interact socially, and diving into Natural Language Processing.
                    Part of my hands-on experience was designing a robotic guitar tuner for my bachelor's project. For
                    my master's thesis, I developed NLP applications that help make social robots more engaging and
                    intuitive.

                    My current research interests are pretty broad, with a strong focus on Natural Language Processing.
                    But I'm also passionate about Social Robotics, Deep Learning, and Deep Reinforcement Learning, as
                    well as how robots cognitively perceive and interact with the world.

                        <h3>GERT: Transformers for Co-speech Gesture Prediction in Social Robots</h3>
                        <p>GERT (Gesture-Enhanced Robotics Transformer), a set of three transformer-based models
                            designed to
                            predict gestures that align with a robot's verbal communication. The research evaluates and
                            compares the effectiveness and efficiency of the three model variations, demonstrating that
                            they
                            all perform well (with F-scores ranging from 0.78 to 0.86) while highlighting the balance
                            between model size and performance.
